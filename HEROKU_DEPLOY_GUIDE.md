### **STEP 3: Deploy Your Backend (3 minutes)**

Now the magic happens!

1. **Open Terminal/Command Prompt**

2. **Navigate to your backend folder**:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Downloads/booking-system/backend
   ```
   
   *(Adjust path if your folder is elsewhere)*

3. **Login to Heroku**:
   ```bash
   heroku login
   ```
   
   - A browser window opens
   - Click "Log in"
   - Return to terminal - you're logged in! ✅

4. **Create a new Heroku app**:
   ```bash
   heroku create my-booking-api
   ```
   
   *(Change `my-booking-api` to whatever name you want)*
   
   You'll see:
   ```
   Creating ⬢ my-booking-api... done
   https://my-booking-api.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/my-booking-api.git
   ```
   
   **COPY THAT URL!** That's your backend! 🎉

5. **Initialize git** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

6. **Add all files**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

7. **Commit**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

8. **Deploy to Heroku**:
   ```bash
   git push heroku main
   ```
   
   OR if that doesn't work:
   ```bash
   git push heroku master
   ```
   
   You'll see lots of text scrolling... wait for it...
   
   ```
   -----> Build succeeded!
   -----> Launching...
   -----> https://my-booking-api.herokuapp.com/ deployed to Heroku
   ```

9. **Test your backend**:
   ```bash
   heroku open
   ```
   
   OR just open in browser:
   ```
   https://my-booking-api.herokuapp.com/api/bookings
   ```
   
   You should see:
   ```json
   {"bookings":[]}
   ```

**YOUR BACKEND IS LIVE!** 🎉🎉🎉

## 📝 Update Your Frontend

Now connect your frontend to Heroku:

1. **Open** `frontend/index.html` in TextEdit

2. **Find line 442**:
   ```javascript

   ```

3. **Replace with your Heroku URL**:
   ```javascript
   const API_BASE_URL = 'https://my-booking-api.herokuapp.com/api';
   ```
   
   *(Use YOUR actual app name from step 3.4)*

4. **Save**

5. **Test** - open `frontend/index.html` in browser

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### **Problem: "git: command not found"**

**Solution:** Install git first

**Mac:**
```bash
brew install git
```

**Windows:**
Download from: https://git-scm.com/download/win

### **Problem: "heroku: command not found"**

**Solution:** Heroku CLI not installed properly

- Restart Terminal/Command Prompt
- Try installation again
- Make sure you downloaded the correct version

### **Problem: "App name is already taken"**

**Solution:** Choose a different name

```bash
heroku create my-booking-api-2024
```

Or let Heroku auto-generate:
```bash
heroku create
```

### **Problem: "failed to push some refs"**

**Solution:** Set the correct branch

```bash
git branch -M main
git push heroku main
```

### **Problem: Application Error when opening URL**

**Solution:** Check logs

```bash
heroku logs --tail
```

Look for errors in red. Most common: PORT not set correctly (already fixed in your files!)

## 🎯 Your URLs

After deployment, you'll have:

**Backend API:**
```
https://YOUR-APP-NAME.herokuapp.com/api/bookings
https://YOUR-APP-NAME.herokuapp.com/api/available-slots
```

**Use in frontend:**
```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = 'https://YOUR-APP-NAME.herokuapp.com/api';
```

You can manage your app at: https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps

**What you can do:**

## 💰 Heroku Free Tier

**What you get:**
